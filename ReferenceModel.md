# Reference Model <a id="referencemodel"></a>

This section provides an explanation of the reference model, which is an implementation of each of the components in the framework. 

The set of core components provided in this release is as follows;
* **[eve](#eve)** is the event distributing utility. Based on the number of events in the input and the number of processes specified as a parameter, eve outputs subsets of the events as a stream. The output streams into getmodel.
* **[getmodel](#getmodel)** generates a stream of effective damageability cdfs for the input stream of events. The reference example reads in Oasis format damage cdf data from binary file. getmodel streams into gulcalc or can be output to a binary file.
* **[gulcalc](#gulcalc)** performs the ground up loss sampling calculations and numerical integration. The output is the Oasis kernel gul sample table. This can be output to a binary file or streamed into  fmcalc or outputcalc.
* **[fmcalc](#fmcalc)** performs the insured loss calculations on the ground up loss samples and mean. The output is the Oasis format loss sample table. The functionality covered in fmcalc is the same as the current financial Module in Oasis R1.4 (see R1.2 Financial Module documentation for more information).  The result can be output to a binary file or streamed into outputcalc.
* **[outputcalc](#outputcalc)** performs an output analysis on the ground up or loss samples. The reference example is an event loss table containing TIV, sample mean and standard deviation for each event at portfolio/programme summary level. The results are written directly into csv file as there is no downstream processing.

Other components in the Reference Model include;
* **[Input data components](Inputtools.md)** to convert input data between csv and binary.
* **[Output data components](Outputtools.md)** to convert the binary data stream output to csv.

Figure 1 shows the data stream workflow of the reference model with its particular internal data files.

##### Figure 1. Reference Model Workflow
![alt text](https://github.com/OasisLMF/ktools/blob/master/docs/img/KtoolsWorkflow.jpg "Reference Model Workflow")

The input data for the reference components, shown as red source files, are the events, Damage CDFs, Exposure Instance, Damage Bin Dictionary and FM Instance.  These are Oasis concepts with Oasis format data as outlined below.

The following sections explain the usage and internal processes of each of the reference components. The standard input and output data streams for the components are generic and are covered in the Specification. The input data requirements are covered in [Input data components](Inputtools.md).

<a id="eve"></a>
## eve
eve takes as input a list of event ids in binary format and generates a partition of event ids as a binary data stream, according to the parameters supplied. 

##### Stream_id
None. The output stream is a simple list of event_ids (4 byte integers).

##### Parameters
* chunk number - corresponds to the chunk number in the input file (see below)
* process number - the process number that determines which partition of events are streamed out
* number of processes - the total number of processes which determines the number of partitions

##### Usage
```
$ eve [parameters] > [output].bin
$ eve [parameters] | getmodel [parameters] | gulcalc [parameters] > [stdout].bin
```

##### Example
```
$ eve 1 1 2 > events1_2.bin 
$ eve 1 1 2 | getmodel 1 | gulcalc -C1 -S100 > gulcalc.bin
```

In this example, the events from the file e_chunk_1_data.bin will be read into memory and the first half (partition 1 of 2) would be streamed out to binary file, or downstream to a single process calculation workflow.

##### Internal data
The program requires an event binary. The file is picked up from the directory where the program is invoked and has the following filename;
* e_chunk_{chunk}_data.bin

The data structure of e_chunk_{chunk}_data.bin is a simple list of event ids (4 byte integers).

<a id="getmodel"></a>
## getmodel 

getmodel generates a stream of effective damageability distributions (cdfs) from an input list of events. Specifically, it reads pre-generated Oasis format cdfs and converts them into a binary stream. The source input data must have been generated as binary files by a separate program.

This is reference example of the class of programs which generates the damage distributions for an event set and streams them into memory. It is envisaged that model developers who wish to use the toolkit as a back-end calculator of their existing platforms can write their own version of getmodel, reading in their own source data and converting it into the standard output stream. As long as the standard input and output structures are adhered to, the program can be written in any language and read any input data.

##### Stream_id

| Byte 1 | Bytes 2-4 |  Description                                   |
|:-------|-----------|:-----------------------------------------------|
|    0   |     1     |  getmodel reference example                    |

##### Parameters
The single parameter is chunk_id (int). 

##### Usage
```
$ [stdin component] | getmodel [parameters] | [stout component]
$ [stdin component] | getmodel [parameters] > [stdout].bin
$ getmodel [parameters] < [stdin].bin > [stdout].bin
```

##### Example
```
$ eve 1 1 1 | getmodel 1 | gulcalc -C1 -S100
$ eve 1 1 1 | getmodel 1 > cdf_chunk1.bin
$ getmodel 1 < e_chunk1_data.bin > cdf_chunk1.bin 
```

##### Internal data
The program requires the damage bin dictionary for the model, the Oasis damage cdf in chunks, and an index file for each cdf chunk as binary files. The files are picked up from the directory where the program is invoked and have the following filenames;
* damage_bin_dictionary.bin

And in a cdf specific subdirectory;
* cdf/damage_cdf_chunk_{chunk_id}.bin
* cdf/damage_cdf_chunk_{chunk_id}.idx

The cdfs are ordered by event and streamed out in blocks for each event. 

Note that the prob_from field from the existing database table structure of Oasis damage cdfs has been dropped to minimise the size of the table, as it is implied from the prior record prob_to field.

##### Calculation
The program reads the damage bin mid-point (interpolation field) from the damage bin dictionary and includes it as a new field in the CDF stream as 'bin_mean'.  This field is the conditional mean damage for the bin and it is used to facilitate the calculation of mean and standard deviation in the gulcalc component. No calculations are performed except to construct the standard output stream.

<a id="gulcalc"></a>
## gulcalc 
The gulcalc program performs Monte Carlo sampling of ground up loss and calculates mean and standard deviation by numerical integration of the cdfs. The sampling methodology of Oasis classic has been extended beyond linear interpolation to include bin value sampling and quadratic interpolation. This supports damage bin intervals which represent a single discrete damage value, and damage distributions with cdfs that are described by a piecewise quadratic function.

##### Parameters
The parameters are;
* -C chunk_id
* -S number of samples
* -R reconciliation mode (optional)
* -r read random numbers from file (optional)
* -L loss threshold (optional)
* -d output random numbers (optional)

##### Usage
```
$ [stdin component] | gulcalc [parameters] | [stout component]
$ [stdin component] | gulcalc [parameters] > [stdout].bin
$ gulcalc [parameters] < [stdin].bin > [stdout].bin
```

##### Example
```
$ eve 1 1 1 | getmodel 1 | gulcalc -C1 -S100 | fmcalc
$ eve 1 1 1 | getmodel 1 | gulcalc -C1 -S100 > gul_chunk1.bin
$ gulcalc -C1 -S100 < cdf_chunk1.bin > gul_chunk1.bin 
```

##### Internal data
The program requires the damage bin dictionary for the model and the exposure instance table, both as binary files. The files are picked up from the directory where the program is invoked and have the following filenames;
* damage_bin_dictionary.bin
* exposures.bin

If the user specifies -r as a parameter, then the program also picks up a random number file from the working directory. The filename is;
random_{chunk_id}.bin

##### Calculation
The program constructs a cdf for each item, based on matching the areaperil_id and vulnerability_id from the stdin and the exposure data. The stdin stream is a block of cdfs which are ordered by event_id, areaperil_id, vulnerability_id and bin_index asccending.

For each item cdf and for the number of samples specified, the program reads a random number from the random number file if the -r parameter is used and uses it to sample ground up loss from the cdf using one of three methods. If the -r parameter is not used, a random number is generated on the fly for each event and group of items which have a common group_id using the Mersenne twister psuedo random number generator (the default RNG of the C++ v11 compiler).

For a given damage interval corresponding to a cumulative probability interval that each random number falls within;
* If the conditional mean damage (of the cdf) is the mid-point of the damage bin interval (of the damage bin dictionary) then the gulcalc program performs linear interpolation. 
* If the conditional mean damage is equal to the lower and upper damage threshold of the damage bin interval (i.e the bin represents a damage value, not a range) then that value is sampled.
* Else, the gulcalc program performs quadrative interpolation.

An example of the three cases and methods is given below;
 
| bin_from | bin_to |  bin_mean | Method used             |
|:---------|--------|-----------| :-----------------------|
|    0.1   |  0.2   |    0.15   | Linear interpolation    |
|    0.1   |  0.1   |    0.1    | Sample bin value        |
|    0.1   |  0.2   |    0.14   | Quadratic interpolation |

Each sampled damage is multiplied by the item TIV and output to the stdout stream.

A second calculation which occurs in the gulcalc program is of the mean and standard deviation of ground up loss. For each cdf, the mean and standard deviation of damage is calculated by numerical integration of the effective damageability probability distribution and the result is multiplied by the item TIV. The results are output to the stdout stream as IDX=-1 (mean) and IDX=-2 (standard deviation), for each item and event.

<a id="fmcalc"></a>
## fmcalc 
fmcalc is the in-memory implementation of the Oasis Financial Module. It applies policy terms and conditions to the ground up losses and produces insured loss sample output.

##### Stream_id

|    2   |     1     |  fmcalc reference example                      |

##### Parameters
There are no parameters as all of the information is taken from the gul stdout stream and internal data.

##### Usage
```
$ [stdin component] | fmcalc | [stout component]
$ [stdin component] | fmcalc > [stdout].bin
$ fmcalc < [stdin].bin > [stdout].bin
```

$ fmcalc < gul_chunk1.bin > fm_chunk1.bin 
```

##### Internal data
The program requires the FM Instance data, which is the Oasis native format data tables which describe an insurance programme. These four tables have been combined into one which has the following data structure;

##### Calculation
fmcalc performs the same calculations as the Oasis Financial Module in R1.5.  Information about the Oasis Financial Module can be found on the public area of the Oasis Loss Modelling Framework website, and detailed information and examples are available to Oasis community members in the members area.

<a id="outputcalc"></a>
## outputcalc 
The reference example of an output produces an event loss table 'ELT' for either ground up loss or insured losses.

##### Stream_id

There is no output stream_id, the results table is written directly to csv.

##### Parameters
There are no parameters as all of the information is taken from the input stream and internal data.

##### Usage
Either gulcalc or fmcalc stdout can be input streams to outputcalc
```
$ [stdin component] | outputcalc | [output].csv
$ outputcalc < [stdin].bin > [output].csv
```

##### Example
Either gulcalc or fmcalc stdout streams can be input streams to outputcalc. For example;
```
$ eve 1 1 1 | getmodel 1 | gulcalc -C1 -S100 | outputcalc > output.csv
$ eve 1 1 1 | getmodel 1 | gulcalc -C1 -S100 | fmcalc | outputcalc > output.csv
$ outputcalc < gul.bin > output.csv
$ outputcalc < fm.bin > output.csv
```

##### Internal data
The program requires the exposures.bin file, and for fmcalc input it requires an additional cross reference file to relate the output_id from the fm stdout stream (which represents an abstract grouping of exposure items) back to the original item_id. This file is picked up from the fm subdirectory;

fm/fmxref.bin

##### Calculation
The program sums the sampled losses from either gulcalc stream or fmstream across the portfolio/programme by event and sample, and then computes sample mean and standard deviation. It reads the TIVs from the exposure instance table and sums them for the group of items affected by each event.
