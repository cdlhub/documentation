<a id="eve"></a>
### eve
***
eve takes as input a list of event ids in binary format and generates a partition of event ids as a binary data stream, according to the parameters supplied. 

##### Stream_id
None. The output stream is a simple list of event_ids (4 byte integers).

##### Parameters
* process number - determines which partition of events to output to a single process
* number of processes - determines the total number of partitions of events to distribute to processes

##### Usage
```
$ eve [parameters] > [output].bin
$ eve [parameters] | getmodel | gulcalc [parameters] > [stdout].bin
```

##### Example
```
$ eve 1 2 > events1_2.bin 
$ eve 1 2 | getmodel | gulcalc -S100 -i - > gulcalc.bin
```

In this example, the events from the file **events.bin** will be read into memory and the first half (partition 1 of 2) would be streamed out to binary file, or downstream to a single process calculation workflow.

##### Internal data
The program requires an event binary. The file is picked up from the **input** sub-directory relative to where the program is invoked and has the following filename;
* input/events.bin

The data structure of events.bin is a simple list of event ids (4 byte integers).

### getmodel 
***
getmodel generates a stream of effective damageability distributions (cdfs) from an input list of events. Specifically, it combines the probability distributions from the model files, eventfootprint.bin and vulnerability.bin, to generate effective damageability cdfs for the subset of exposures contained in the items.bin file and converts them into a binary stream. The source input data must have been generated as binary files by a separate program.

This is reference example of the class of programs which generates the damage distributions for an event set and streams them into memory. It is envisaged that model developers who wish to use the toolkit as a back-end calculator of their existing platforms can write their own version of getmodel, reading in their own source data and converting it into the standard output stream. As long as the standard input and output structures are adhered to, the program can be written in any language and read any input data.

|    0   |     1     |  getmodel reference example                    |

##### Parameters
None

##### Usage
```
$ [stdin component] | getmodel | [stout component]
$ [stdin component] | getmodel > [stdout].bin
$ getmodel < [stdin].bin > [stdout].bin
```

##### Example
```
$ eve 1 1 | getmodel | gulcalc -r -S100 -i gulcalci.bin
$ eve 1 1 | getmodel > getmodel.bin
$ getmodel < events.bin > getmodel.bin 
```

##### Internal data
The program requires the eventfootprint binary and index file for the model, the vulnerability binary model file, the items file representing the user's exposures. The files are picked up from sub-directories relative to where the program is invoked, as follows;

* static/eventfootprint.bin
* static/eventfootprint.idx
* static/vulnerability.bin
* static/damage_bin_dict.bin
* input/items.bin

The getmodel output stream is ordered by event and streamed out in blocks for each event. 

##### Calculation
The program filters the eventfootprint binary file for all 'areaperil_id's which appear in the items file. This selects the event footprints that affect the exposures on the basis on their location, and discards the rest.  Similarly the program filters the vulnerability file for 'vulnerability_id's that appear in the items file. This removes damage distributions which are not relevant for the exposures. Then the intensity distributions from the eventfootprint file and conditional damage distributions from the vulnerability file are convolved for every combination of areaperil_id and vulnerability_id in the items file. The effective damage probabilities are calculated by a sum product of conditional damage probabilities with intensity probabilities for each event, areaperil, vulnerability combination and each damage bin.  The resulting discrete probability distributions are converted into discrete cumulative distribution functions 'cdfs'.  Finally, the damage bin mid-point from the damage bin dictionary ('interpolation' field) is read in as a new field in the cdf stream as 'bin_mean'.  This field is the conditional mean damage for the bin and it is used to facilitate the calculation of mean and standard deviation in the gulcalc component.

<a id="gulcalc"></a>
### gulcalc
***
The gulcalc program performs Monte Carlo sampling of ground up loss and calculates mean and standard deviation by numerical integration of the cdfs. The sampling methodology has been extended beyond linear interpolation to include point value sampling and quadratic interpolation. This supports damage bin intervals which represent a single discrete damage value, and damage distributions with cdfs that are described by a piecewise quadratic function.

##### Parameters
Required parameters are;
* -R{number} or -r.  Number of random numbers to generate or read random numbers from file
* -S{number}. Number of samples
* -c or -i {destination}. There are two alternative streams, 'coverage' or 'item'. 
The destination is either a filename or named pipe, or use - for standard output.

Optional parameters are;

* -L{number} loss threshold (optional) excludes losses below the threshold from the output stream
* -d debug mode - output random numbers rather than losses (optional)

##### Usage
```
$ [stdin component] | gulcalc [parameters] | [stout component]
$ [stdin component] | gulcalc [parameters]
$ gulcalc [parameters] < [stdin].bin 
```

##### Example
```
$ eve 1 1 | getmodel | gulcalc -R1000000 -S100 -i - | fmcalc > fmcalc.bin
$ eve 1 1 | getmodel | gulcalc -R1000000 -S100 -c - | summarycalc -g -1 summarycalc1.bin
$ eve 1 1 | getmodel | gulcalc -r -S100 -i gulcalci.bin
$ eve 1 1 | getmodel | gulcalc -r -S100 -c gulcalcc.bin
$ gulcalc -r -S100 -c gulcalcc.bin < getmodel.bin 
```

##### Internal data
The program requires the damage bin dictionary for the static folder and the item and coverage files from the input folder, all binary files. The files are found in the following locations relative to the working directory with the filenames;

* static/damage_bin_dictionary.bin
* input/items.bin
* input/coverages.bin

If the user specifies -r as a parameter, then the program also picks up a random number file from the static directory. The filename is;
* static/random.bin

##### Calculation
The stdin stream is a block of cdfs which are ordered by event_id, areaperil_id, vulnerability_id and bin_index asccending, from getmodel. The gulcalc program constructs a cdf for each item, based on matching the areaperil_id and vulnerability_id from the stdin and the item file.

For each item cdf and for the number of samples specified, the program draws a random number and uses it to sample ground up loss from the cdf using one of three methods, as follows;

For a given damage interval corresponding to a cumulative probability interval that each random number falls within;
* If the conditional mean damage (of the cdf) is the mid-point of the damage bin interval (of the damage bin dictionary) then the gulcalc program performs linear interpolation. 
* If the conditional mean damage is equal to the lower and upper damage threshold of the damage bin interval (i.e the bin represents a damage value, not a range) then that value is sampled.
* Else, the gulcalc program performs quadrative interpolation using the bin_mean to calculate the quadratic equation in the damage interval.

An example of the three cases and methods is given below;
 
| bin_from | bin_to |  bin_mean | Method used             |
|:---------|--------|-----------| :-----------------------|
|    0.1   |  0.2   |    0.15   | Linear interpolation    |
|    0.1   |  0.1   |    0.1    | Sample bin value        |
|    0.1   |  0.2   |    0.14   | Quadratic interpolation |

Each sampled damage is multiplied by the item TIV, looked up from the coverage file.

If the -i parameter is specified, then the ground up losses for the items are output to the stream (stream_id 1).
If the -c parameter is specified, then the ground up losses for the items are grouped by coverage and capped to the coverage TIV, and the ground up losses for the coverages are output to the stream (stream_id 2).

The purpose of the coverage stream is to cap losses to the coverage TIV where items represent damage to the same coverage from different perils.

A final calculation which occurs in the gulcalc program is of the mean and standard deviation of ground up loss. For each cdf, the mean and standard deviation of damage is calculated by numerical integration of the effective damageability probability distribution and the result is multiplied by the TIV. The results are included in the output to the stdout stream as sidx=-1 (mean) and sidx=-2 (standard deviation), for each event and item (or coverage).

If the -R parameter is used along with a specified number of random numbers then random numbers used for sampling are generated on the fly for each event and group of items which have a common group_id using the Mersenne twister psuedo random number generator (the default RNG of the C++ v11 compiler).  if the -r parameter is used, gulcalc reads a random number from the provided random number file. See [Random Numbers](RandomNumbers.md) for more details.

<a id="fmcalc"></a>
### fmcalc
***
fmcalc is the in-memory implementation of the Oasis Financial Module. It applies policy terms and conditions to the ground up losses and produces insured loss sample output.  It takes in losses from gulcalc at item level only (stream_id = 1). 

##### Stream_id

|    2   |     1     |  fmcalc reference example                      |

##### Parameters
There are no parameters as all of the information is taken from the gul stdout stream and fm input data.

##### Usage
```
$ [stdin component] | fmcalc | [stout component]
$ [stdin component] | fmcalc > [stdout].bin
$ fmcalc < [stdin].bin > [stdout].bin
```

##### Example
```
$ eve 1 1 | getmodel | gulcalc -r -S100 -i - | fmcalc | summarycalc -f -2 - | eltcalc > elt.csv
$ eve 1 1 | getmodel | gulcalc -r -S100 -i - | fmcalc > fmcalc.bin
$ fmcalc < gulcalc.bin > fmcalc.bin 
```

##### Internal data
The program requires the item, coverage and fm input data, which are Oasis abstract data objects that describe an insurance programme. This data is picked up from the following files relative to the working directory;

* input/items.bin
* input/coverages.bin
* input/fm_programme.bin
* input/fm_policytc.bin
* input/fm_profile.bin
* input/fm_xref.bin

<a id="summarycalc"></a>
### summarycalc 
***
The purpose of summarycalc is firstly to aggregate the samples of loss to a level of interest for reporting, thereby reducing the volume of data in the stream. This is a general first step which precedes all of the downstream output calculations.  Secondly, it unifies the formats of the gulcalc and fmcalc streams, so that they are transformed into an identical stream type for downstream outputs. Finally, it can generate up to 10 summary level outputs in one go, creating multiple output streams or files.

The output is similar to the gulcalc or fmcalc input which are losses are by sample index and by event, but the coverage or policy input losses are grouped to an abstract level represented by a summary_id.  The relationship between the input identifier and the summary_id are defined in cross reference files called **gulsummaryxref** and **fmsummaryxref**.

##### Stream_id

| Byte 1 | Bytes 2-4 |  Description                                   |
|:-------|-----------|:-----------------------------------------------|
|    3   |     1     |  summarycalc reference example                 |

##### Parameters

The input stream should be identified explicitly as -g for gulcalc stream or -f for fmcalc stream.

summarycalc supports up to 10 concurrent outputs.  This is achieved by explictly directing each output to a named pipe, file, or to standard output.  

For each output stream, the following tuple of parameters must be specified for at least one summary set;

* summaryset_id number. valid values are -0 to -9
* destination pipe or file. Use either - for standard output, or {name} for a named pipe or file.

For example the following parameter choices are valid;
```
$ summarycalc -g -1 -                                       
'outputs summaryset 1 results to standard output
$ summarycalc -g -1 summarycalc1.bin                        
'outputs summaryset 1 results to a file (or named pipe)
$ summarycalc -g -1 summarycalc1.bin -2 summarycalc2.bin    
'outputs summaryset 1 and 2 results to a file (or named pipe)
```
Note that the summaryset_id relates to a summaryset_id in the required input data file **gulsummaryxref.bin** or **fmsummaryxref.bin** for a gulcalc input stream or a fmcalc input stream, respectively, and represents a user specified summary reporting level. For example summaryset_id = 1 represents portfolio level, summaryset_id = 2 represents zipcode level and summaryset_id 3 represents site level.

##### Usage
```
$ [stdin component] | summarycalc [parameters] | [stdout component]
$ [stdin component] | summarycalc [parameters]
$ summarycalc [parameters] < [stdin].bin
```

##### Example

```
$ eve 1 1 | getmodel | gulcalc -S100 -c - | summarycalc -g -1 - | eltcalc > eltcalc.csv
$ eve 1 1 | getmodel | gulcalc -S100 -c - | summarycalc -g -1 gulsummarycalc.bin 
$ summarycalc -f -1 fmsummarycalc.bin < fmcalc.bin
```

##### Internal data
The program requires the gulsummaryxref file for gulcalc input (-g option), or the fmsummaryxref file for fmcalc input (-f option). This data is picked up from the following files relative to the working directory;

* input/gulsummaryxref.bin
* input/fmsummaryxref.bin

##### Calculation
summarycalc takes either ground up loss (by coverage) or insured loss samples (by policy) as input and aggregates them to a user-defined summary reporting level. The output is similar to the input which are losses are by sample index and by event, but the coverage or policy input losses are grouped to an abstract level represented by a summary_id.  The relationship between the input identifier, coverage_id for gulcalc or output_id for fmcalc, and the summary_id are defined in the internal data files.

summarycalc also calculates the maximum exposure value by summary_id and event_id. This is carried through in the stream header and output by eltcalc, aalcalc and pltcalc. For ground up losses this is the sum of TIV for all coverages which have a non-zero sampled ground up loss for a given event. For insured losses, this is the sum of the losses for sample index -3 from the fmcalc stdout stream.  Sample index -3 is the TIV of the items in the programme which have been passed through the financial module calculations to take account of the deductibles and limits.  Essentially, it is a 100% damage scenario for all items simultaneously.
